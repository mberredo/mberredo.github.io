Given the success of IFood (The Brazilian version of Doordash) in Brazil and so many good comments from my friends, I was intrigued by why they like IFood so much! 

I also wondered who is ordering from the platform and what the trends were. In this case study, I analyzed the IFood data from 2018 and here are the key takeaways:

- 1.24M was spent on IFood in 2018
- 64% of the spend variance can be explained by the income levels
- Growth throughout the year was mostly constant at 183 customers per month with November & December being the lowest & January being the highest
- Families with less kids spent considerably more 
- The Age Group that consumed the most is in the range of 50 to 65 years old
- The Wine products are the best sellers and the top revenue generator
